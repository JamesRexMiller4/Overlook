## Want to see the working version? 

Until I get the GH pages setup for this repo, feel free to clone down using git clone into a directory of your choosing. Then run npm install to load all the dependencies and run webpack's configuration file to get you up and running. Once that is finished installing, simply run the command npm start and a url link to a local live server is available for you to copy and paste into your browser

## Webpack?

If you look in the `package.json` file, you'll see one of the library dependencies called `webpack`. If you're interested in learning more about what Webpack is and how it works behind the scenes, take a look through the [Webpack configuration documentation](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/).

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

_If you are finished with the functionality and testing of your project_, then you can consider deploying your project to the web! This way anyone can play it without cloning down your repo.

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is a great way to deploy your project to the web. Don't worry about this until your project is free of bugs and well tested!

If you _are_ done, you can follow [this procedure](./gh-pages-procedure.md) to get your project live on GitHub Pages.
